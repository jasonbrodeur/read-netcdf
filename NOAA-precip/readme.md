These files have been generated by JJB using the `extract_nc.m` MATLAB script shared in this folder. 

Files are shared with a suffix (mon1, mon2, mon3,...) that represents the month of year (jan, feb, mar,...). 

Files are structured with latitude down rows and longitude across columns (labels are provided in the first row and column).
